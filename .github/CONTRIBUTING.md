# Contributing

## Request for changes/ Pull Requests
You first need to create a fork of the [ML.core](https://github.com/hellofiremind/ml.core/) repository to commit your changes to it. Methods to fork a repository can be found in the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

Then add your fork as a local project:

```sh
# Using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/hellofiremind/ml.core.git

# Using SSH
git clone git@github.com:hellofiremind/ml.core.git
```

> [Which remote URL should be used ?](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories)

Then, go to your local folder

```sh
cd ml.core
```

Add git remote controls:

```sh
# Using HTTPS
git remote add fork https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ml.core.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/hellofiremind/ml.core.git


# Using SSH
git remote add fork git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/ml.core.git
git remote add upstream git@github.com/hellofiremind/ml.core.git
```

You can now verify that you have your two git remotes:

```sh
git remote -v
```

## Receive remote updates
In view of staying up to date with the central repository:

```sh
git pull upstream development
```

## Choose a base branch
Before starting development, you need to know which branch to base your modifications/additions on. When in doubt, use development.

| Type of change                |           | Branches              |
| :------------------           |:---------:| ---------------------:|
| Documentation                 |           | `development`         |
| Bug fixes                     |           | `development`         |
| New features                  |           | `development`         |
| New issues models             |           | `YOUR-USERNAME:patch` |

```sh
# Switch to the desired branch
git switch development

# Pull down any upstream changes
git pull

# Create a new branch to work on
git switch --create patch/1234-name-issue
```

Commit your changes, then push the branch to your fork with `git push -u fork` and open a pull request on [the ml.core repository](https://github.com/hellofiremind/ml.core/) following the template provided.
